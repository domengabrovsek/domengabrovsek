## What I do

I design and build cloud-native systems at scale, with 10+ years of experience in backend development and infrastructure engineering. 

Currently working at [Didomi](https://www.didomi.io/) 🔒 building privacy solutions that help organizations navigate complex regulatory landscapes.

I'm passionate about automation, simplification, and writing code that's straightforward to test and maintain. If there's a manual process, I'll find a way to automate it. If there's complexity, I'll work to simplify it.

### What I work with

☁️ AWS • GCP  
⚡ TypeScript/Node.js  
🏗️ Terraform/CDK

## How I work

I build production-grade systems that handle scale - from resilient backend services to event-driven architectures and automated infrastructure deployment. My approach emphasizes clean architecture, simple and testable code, and operational excellence.

As a digital privacy enthusiast, I'm particularly interested in building systems that respect user privacy by design while maintaining performance and usability.
